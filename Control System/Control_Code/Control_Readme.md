****Based on the Micropython code for controlling a motor via Bluetooth provided in [APP_Control_Speed], the basic motion control of the device was tested to ensure that it responded to commands sent by Bluetooth as expected. The code covers the basic operations of the car, such as forward, reverse, stop, speed change and steering, activated by different Bluetooth commands. During the testing process, each function was carefully verified to evaluate the car's performance and responsiveness, especially in terms of safe stopping and precise control. Due to the serial connection, once the application is connected to the HC-05 module, the microcontroller is constantly searching for UART commands from the terminal. This code initializes all the pins used on the device and then creates a PWM object (using the imported machine library) that sets them all to pulse width modulation of 9600Hz. Different commands seen in the block code use different strings, when a specific string is received from Bluetooth, the microcontroller adjusts the duty cycle of the corresponding PWM to control the rotation of the motor, such as forward movement, reverse backward movement .****


**In the code implementation of [Two_Motors_Test], I show how to integrate the vision system with the car's control system to achieve automatic control based on visual input. By initializing a UART interface specifically for the vision system, the car can receive and decode instructions from the vision system. These commands will instruct the car to move forward ('F'), move backward ('B'), or stop ('S'). For example, when the vision system detects an obstacle, it sends an "S" command to the control system, prompting the control system to instruct the motor to stop immediately. If the obstacle is removed or no longer exists, the vision system sends an "F" or "B" command to the control system, instructing the car to continue its previous direction of movement. This integrated mechanism provides the car with flexible dynamic control, allowing it to respond autonomously based on environmental information captured by the vision system. This not only enhances the car's navigation capabilities in unknown or complex environments, but also greatly improves its level of intelligence. Received vision system commands are received through the dedicated UART port and decoded and converted into UTF-8 formatted text. Then, according to these instructions, the system calls the predefined "motor_control" function, which controls the speed and direction of the motor by adjusting the PWM signal to accurately manage the motion state of the car.******
