Based on the Micropython code for controlling a motor via Bluetooth provided in APP_Control_Speed, the basic motion control of the device was tested to ensure that it responded to commands sent by Bluetooth as expected. The code covers the basic operations of the car, such as forward, reverse, stop, speed change and steering, activated by different Bluetooth commands. During the testing process, each function was carefully verified to evaluate the car's performance and responsiveness, especially in terms of safe stopping and precise control. Due to the serial connection, once the application is connected to the HC-05 module, the microcontroller is constantly searching for UART commands from the terminal. This code initializes all the pins used on the device and then creates a PWM object (using the imported machine library) that sets them all to pulse width modulation of 9600Hz. Different commands seen in the block code use different strings, when a specific string is received from Bluetooth, the microcontroller adjusts the duty cycle of the corresponding PWM to control the rotation of the motor, such as forward movement, reverse backward movement .
